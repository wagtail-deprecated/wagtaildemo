# If you're developing Wagtail itself (as opposed to building a Wagtail-powered site), you'll
# want to tweak the Python path so that it picks up your working copy of the Wagtail code
# rather than the packaged copy - uncomment the lines below to do that.
# Here we assume that you have it in a 'wagtail' directory at the same level as your
# 'wagtaildemo' checkout - adjust the path as appropriate.
